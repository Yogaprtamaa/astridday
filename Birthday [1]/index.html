            Happy Birthday, Astrid 💛
On your special day, I want to remind you how deeply loved, admired, and supported you are — not just as my partner, but as the amazing person you are becoming.I know you’re working so hard right now, pouring your heart and energy into your dreams — especially your journey toward college. And I just want to say: I believe in you, completely. No matter how tough the road feels, you have everything it takes to get where you want to be.So today, I hope you take a deep breath, smile, and feel proud — not just because it's your birthday, but because you’re doing something brave, something meaningful. Happy birthday, my love.
With all my heart,
            [Yoga]🎉🎂❤️🥂
